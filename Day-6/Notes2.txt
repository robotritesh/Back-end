Give me all the unique genders and the number of people from each gender SQL:-
SELECT gender, COUNT(*)
FROM customers
GROUP BY gender;
MONGO:-

db.Customers.aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$gender", count: {$count: {}}}}])

Give me all the unique genders and the average age of each gender
db.Customers.aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$gender", AverageAge: {$avg: "$salary"}}}])
Give me the avg of all the people
db.Customers.aggregate([{$group: {_id: 1, AverageAge: {$avg: "$salary"}}}])
Group by first_name and age SQL:-
select first_name, age from customers group by first_name, age

MONGO:-

 db.Customers.aggregate([{$group: {_id: {name: "$first_name", gender: "$gender"}, AverageAge: {$avg: "$salary"}}}])
I want to get the unique gender of those people who are above the age 50 and their avg sal
db.Customers.aggregate([
    {$match: {age: {$gte: 50}}}, 
    {$group: {_id: "$gender", average: {$avg: "$salary"}}}
])

I want to get all the unique genders and the average sal where avg sal is >= 25000
db.Customers.aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$gender", AverageAge: {$avg: "$salary"}}}, {$match: {AverageAge: {$gte: 25000}}}])
Print the full name of all those users who have age >= 40
db.Customers.aggregate([{$project: {full_name: {$concat: ["$first_name", " ", "$last_name"]}, age: 1}}, {$match: {age: {$gte: 40}}}])
